            <h1>The Research...</h1>
            <p class="lead mb-0">For a detailed look at the research referenced in the following sentences, please see 'Citations' - at the bottom.

                The empirical research behind writing down future goals (sometimes known as "self-authoring") is powerful and has been replicated across many studies. In essence, this endeavor involves imagining your best possible self and descriptively writing that story down, as if you have achieved and lived out these successes. With a little thought, it's actually a simple and fruitful exercise. For example, picture yourself in 2-3 years, having accomplished all the career, relationship, and educational goals you could imagine. Have you done that? Now, write it down!
                
                Why does this work? Let's dive a little deeper into the research.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>Self Regulation</h2>
            <p class="lead mb-0">Engaging in mentally stimulating activities, exactly like the one described above, have been shown to increase well-being (Rivkin & Taylor, 1999). Additionally, recent research on detailing your best possible self has indicated that, by doing so, one actively engages in an internal dialogue between thought and action, further enabling them to picture the best possible path to get there (Pham & Taylor, 1999). This focus on self-regulation is powerful, as it shifts the individual's mindset towards that of an analytical one - able to structurally break down their goals into sub-tasks that they can then work towards in a sustainable manner. As any goal-setting would know, success is a marathon - not a sprint.

                Another benefit of the analytical mind is that is forces the individual to consider all the possible obstacles they could encounter. Furthermore, these roadblocks would have existed whether or not the individual was prepared for them or not. We can think of this as traveling to the airport. Whether you know it or not, there may be an accident on the highway and this could cause you to miss your flight. However, if you develop a goal-setting mindset that involves actively assessing your path to that goal (in this case, getting to the airport), you may notice this obstacle and take the train instead.</p>

            <h2>Connecting The Dots</h2>
            <p class="lead mb-0">So why is imagining your best possible self so important? Well, imagining your best possible self is the same as imagining the version of you that has realized all the goals that you care about. So, by definition, it's what you're working towards whether you know it or not. However, by knowing that you are working towards it and analyzing your pathway, you begin to activate a higher level in the motivational hierarchy (King, 2001). This higher-level thinking involves considering long-term goals that people don't usually contemplate on a daily basis. However, thinking these goals through is often conducive to connecting dots from the past, to the present, and then the future. For example, let's say that you're at Point B right now, and you want to be at Point C in the future. Point C is now your goal, but it would behoove you to know how you arrived at the present moment in the first place. Using the image below, you can think of this as your transition from Point A to Point B. Often, there were many positive and/or negative lessons that resulted from that transition, and these are beneficial insights to leverage in your pursuit of Point C. It is also important to note that, even if you don't know where your Point C is (maybe you're "lost in life"), you can still leverage this tool to figure it out. How? Research has shown that writing about life goals can bring awareness and clarity to one's purpose, as well as assist in recognizing and developing the personal values that have guided and will continue to guide them forward in this pursuit (King, 2001).</p>

            <h2>Well-Being</h2>
            <p class="lead mb-0">Let's talk about happiness - the ideal that, perhaps, most of us strive for. There's no shortage of books, blog posts, and self-proclaimed prophetic recipes that advise on ways to achieve higher states of well-being. So, how do we sort through the clutter? Leveraging research-driven methods is a great place to start - which brings us back to expressive writing. For instance, writing about your best possible self has been shown to increase life-satisfaction, decrease stress, and even reduce symptoms of physical illnesses (King, 2001). This is not inconsequential. Simply writing about your life goals can make you happier! That's a free and simple solution. Additionally, studies have also shown that engaging in writing exercises, especially ones in which you contemplate traumatic experiences, can help an individual find employment faster after being laid off (Spera, Buhrfeind, & Pennebaker, 1994).</p>
