# 48to1
The Idea: User spends 1 hour over the next 48 writing down their future goals (career, relationship, education, etc.). Then, using machine learning, analyze user's personality traits, mindset (analytic v.s. narrative) , sentiment, and more. Subsequently, provide user-specific empirical research to help them achieve predetermined goals.

Please note that this is a work-in-progress.
