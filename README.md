# 48to1

## In A Nutshell...
A user will spend 1 hour over the course of 48 hours (30 minutes per day) writing down their future goals (career, relationship, education, etc.). Then, using machine learning, 48to1 will analyze their personality traits, mindset (analytic v.s. narrative) , sentiment, and more. Subsequently, 48to1 will provide user-specific empirical research to assist the user in planning and working towards their goals.

Please note that this is a work-in-progress.

## The Research...
_For a detailed look at the research referenced in the following sentences, please see 'Citations' - at the bottom._

The empirical research behind writing down future goals (sometimes known as "self-authoring") is powerful and has been replicated across many studies. In essence, this endeavor involves imagining your ***best possible self*** and descriptively writing that story down, as if you have achieved and lived out these successes. With a little thought, it's actually a simple and fruitful exercise. For example, picture yourself in 2-3 years, having accomplished all the career, relationship, and educational goals you could imagine. Have you done that? Now, write it down!

Why does this work? Let's dive a little deeper into the research. 

#### Self Regulation
Engaging in mentally stimulating activities, exactly like the one described above, have been shown to increase well-being (Rivkin & Taylor, 1999). Additionaly, recent research on detailing your ***best possible self*** has indicated that, by doing so, one actively engages in internal link between *thought* and *action*, further enabling them to picture the *best possible path* to get there (Pham & Taylor, 1999). This focus on self-regulation is powerful, as it shifts the individuals mindset towards that of an analytical one - able to structurally break down their goals into sub-tasks that they can then worl towards in a sustainable manner. As any goal-setting would know, success is a marathon - not a sprint.

Another benefit of the analytical mind is that is forces the individual to consider all the possible obstacles they could encounter. Furthermore, these road-blocks would have existed whether or not the individual was prepared for them or not. We can think of this as traveling to the airport. Whether you know it or not, there may be an accident on the highway and this could cause you to miss your flight. However, if you develop a goal-setting mindset that involves actively assessing your path to that goal (in this case, getting to the airport), you may notice this obstace and take the train instead. This reduction of goal-conflicts has also been detailed in recent research - (Pennebaker, 1998) .


#### Connecting The Dots
So why is imagining your ***best possible self*** so important? Well, imagining your best possible self is the same as imagining the version of **you** that has realized all the goals that **you** care about. So, by definition, it's what you're working towards whether you know it or not. However, by *knowing* that you are working towards it and *analyzing* your pathway, you begin to activate a **higher level in the motivational hierarchy** (King, 2001). This higher-level thinking involves considering long-term goals that people don't usually contemplate on a daily basis. However, thinking these goals through is often conducive to connecting dots from the past, to the present, and then the future. For example, let's say that you're at **Point B** right now, and you want to be at **Point C** in the future. **Point C** is now your goal, but it would behoove you to know how you arrived at the present moment *in the first place*. Using the image below, you can think of this as your transition from **Point A** to **Point B**. Often, there are many positive and/or negative lessons that resulted from that transition, and these are be beneficial insights to leverage in your pursuit of **Point C**. It is also important to note that, even if you *don't know where your **Point C** is (maybe you're "lost in life")*, you can still leverage this tool to figure it out. How? Research has shown that writing about life goals can bring awareness and clarity to one's purpose, as well as assist in recognizing and developing the personal values that have guided and will contintue to guide them forward in this pursuit (King, 2001).
