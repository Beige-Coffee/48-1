# 48to1

## In A Nutshell...
A user will spend 1 hour over the course of 48 hours (30 minutes per day) writing down their future goals (career, relationship, education, etc.). Then, using machine learning, 48to1 will analyze their personality traits, mindset (analytic v.s. narrative) , sentiment, and more. Subsequently, 48to1 will provide user-specific empirical research to assist the user in planning and working towards their goals.

Please note that this is a work-in-progress.

## The Research...
_For a detailed look at the research referenced in the following sentences, please see 'Citations' - at the bottom._

The empirical research behind writing down future goals (sometimes known as "self-authoring") is powerful and has been replicated across many studies. In essence, this endeavor involves imagining your ***best possible self*** and descriptively writing that story down, as if you have achieved and lived out these successes. With a little thought, it's actually a simple and fruitful exercise. For example, picture yourself in 2-3 years, having accomplished all the career, relationship, and educational goals you could imagine. Have you done that? Now, write it down!

Why does this work? Let's dive a little deeper into the research. 

#### Self Regulation
Engaging in mentally stimulating activities, exactly like the one described above, have been shown to increase well-being (Rivkin & Taylor, 1999). Additionaly, recent research on detailing your ***best possible self*** has indicated that, by doing so, one actively engages in internal link between *thought* and *action*, further enabling them to picture the *best possible path* to get there (Pham & Taylor, 1999). This focus on self-regulation is powerful, as it shifts the individuals mindset towards that of an analytical one - able to structurally break down their goals into sub-tasks that they can then worl towards in a sustainable manner. As any goal-setting would know, success is a marathon - not a sprint.

Another benefit of the analytical mind is that is forces the individual to consider all the possible obstacles they could encounter. Furthermore, these road-blocks would have existed whether or not the individual was prepared for them or not. We can think of this as traveling to the airport. Whether you know it or not, there may be an accident on the highway and this could cause you to miss your flight. However, if you develop a goal-setting mindset that involves actively assessing your path to that goal (in this case, getting to the airport), you may notice this obstace and take the train instead. This reduction of goal-conflicts has also been detailed in recent research - (Pennebaker, 1998) .
