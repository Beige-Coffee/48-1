# 48to1

## How it works:
A user will spend 1 hour over the course of 48 hours (30 minutes per day) writing down their future goals (career, relationship, education, etc.). Then, using machine learning, 48to1 will analyze their personality traits, mindset (analytic v.s. narrative) , sentiment, and more. Subsequently, 48to1 will provide user-specific empirical research to assist the user in planning and working towards their goals.

Please note that this is a work-in-progress.
